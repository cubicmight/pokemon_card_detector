# Pokemon-Card-Detector
Python program that uses OpenCV to detect and identify pokemon playing cards


P.S 
I noticed while trying to fix the scraper that this idea has already been done before. Even the scraping and downloading of the cards and identifiying is similar, as they both use gaussian blurring and thresholding. However, we coded it on our own completely.
